For dichromatic (2-colored) descriptions, concatenate one color stem into another using COMITATIVE format.\n\nThe Western basic color terms 'pink' and 'brown' do not have roots. The various shades covered by these two color terms are expressed as derivatives of red or magenta, and orange respectively. Use of the CLD affix also provides terms for more obscure shades such as 'peach', 'mauve', 'turquoise', 'indigo', 'olive', 'rust', 'burnt sienna', 'cobalt blue', 'forest green', 'beige', 'burgundy', etc.\n\nUsing the COL affix in conjunction with the Phase and Modulative affixes, one can add qualities such as 'gleaming', 'twinkling', 'opalescent', 'glittering', etc. In addition to the above scheme, the COL/7 affix provides for terms based on the color of a tangible object."
